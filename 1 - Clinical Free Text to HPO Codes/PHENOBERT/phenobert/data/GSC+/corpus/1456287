We report on the 12-year development of a child with branchio-oculo-facial syndrome who was initially referred at age 5 months. Of note is his normal intelligence, regular class placement, hypernasal speech, and continued growth along the third centile. The importance of serial observations of patients with rare genetic disorders is emphasized.
