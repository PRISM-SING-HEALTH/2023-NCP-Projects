The present report concerns a two-generation family of nine individuals in which the father and three of the six living children all had: (1) a mixed hearing loss with a Mondini type cochlear malformation and stapes fixation; (2) cup-shaped, anteverted pinnae with bilateral prehelical pits: (3) bilateral branchial cleft fistulas; and (4) bilateral renal dysplasia and anomalies of the collecting system. The father and one affected son also had aplasia of the lacrimal ducts. A fourth child who died at 5 months of age was reported to have branchial cleft fistulas and bilateral polycystic kidneys at autopsy. In addition, the concept of noso-embryologic communities is presented. Such groups are composed of syndromes whose total phenotypic spectra not only overlap but also share common elements in embryogenesis. This concept is illustrated with a group of branchial arch syndromes that are related in this way.
