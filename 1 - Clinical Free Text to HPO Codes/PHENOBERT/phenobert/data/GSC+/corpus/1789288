We report on a family in which individuals at risk for NF 2 were investigated with the use of gadolinium-enhanced MRI. This technique has allowed the diagnosis of small (less than 8 mm) acoustic neuromas in two asymptomatic children (age 7 and 11), one of whom had normal audiometric and brainstem-evoked response testing. To our knowledge these are the youngest asymptomatic patients in whom the diagnosis of NF 2 has been demonstrated. It is possible that acoustic neuromas develop at an early age more commonly than recognized previously. The early diagnosis of acoustic neuromas with the use of gadolinium-enhanced MRI may lead to better outcome following surgery. This technique will provide the opportunity to better determine the natural course of this disease.
