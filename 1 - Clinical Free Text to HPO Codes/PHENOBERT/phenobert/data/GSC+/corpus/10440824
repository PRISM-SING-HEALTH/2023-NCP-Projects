We describe a 14-month-old girl with unilateral congenital cholesteatoma and anomalies of the facial nerve in addition to the more common branchial arch, otic, and renal malformations comprising the branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome. Her mother also has the BOR syndrome and unilateral duplication of the facial nerve. This is the first study of a BOR patient with congenital cholesteatoma and the second family in which cholesteatoma and anomalies of the facial nerve are described in patients with the BO/BOR syndrome. We review the congenital cholesteatoma literature and discuss hypotheses for the pathogenesis of this entity in light of this new report.
