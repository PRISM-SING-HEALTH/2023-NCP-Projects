In this report we present a subject affected by nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS), showing also bilateral mandibular coronoid processes hyperplasia, a hitherto unreported association. Our observation of bilateral hyperplasia of the mandibular coronoid processes in a boy with NBCCS may prompt a retrospective and prospective review of other patients affected by this syndrome in order to establish if this anomaly is part of it.
