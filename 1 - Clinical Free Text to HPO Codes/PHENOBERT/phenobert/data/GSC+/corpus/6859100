We report two families in which propositi had severe bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, a preauricular pit or tag, and duplication of the ureters or bifid renal pelvices. Other relatives had one or more of these anomalies in a pattern suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance with reduced penetrance and variable expressivity. We suggest the term "branchio-oto-ureteral syndrome" to designate this condition.
