Mutations of the human Patched gene ( PTCH ) have been identified in individuals with the nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) as well as in sporadic basal cell carcinomas and medulloblastomas. We have isolated a homologue of this tumour suppressor gene and localized it to the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p32.1-32.3). Patched 2 ( PTCH2 ) comprises 22 coding exons and spans approximately 15 kb of genomic DNA. The gene encodes a 1203 amino acid putative transmembrane protein which is highly homologous to the PTCH product. We have characterized the genomic structure of PTCH2 and have used single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis to search for mutations in PTCH2 in NBCCS patients, basal cell carcinomas and in medulloblastomas. To date, we have identified one truncating mutation in a medulloblastoma and a change in a splice donor site in a basal cell carcinoma, suggesting that the gene plays a role in the development of some tumours.
