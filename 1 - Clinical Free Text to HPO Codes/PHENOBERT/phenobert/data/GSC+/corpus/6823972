No difference in survival was observed between cultured cells from basal cell naevus syndrome (BCNS) patients and normal controls following exposure of fibroblasts to ionizing radiation. Potential lethal damage repair in BCNS cells, measured by holding experiments, was also no different from normal. G0-irradiated lymphocytes from BCNS patients were found to have a significantly higher level of X-ray-induced chromosome aberrations compared with normals. This increase is, however, small, and, taken together with the survival data, suggests that increased cell killing as a measure of the unusual clinical radiosensitivity is not the major effect of the BCNS gene.
