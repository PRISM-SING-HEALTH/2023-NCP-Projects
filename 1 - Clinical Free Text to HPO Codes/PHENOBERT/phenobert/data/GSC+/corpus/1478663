Branchiootorenal syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder that affects an estimated 2% of profoundly deaf children. In addition to hearing impairment, it is characterized by a lop-ear deformity, preauricular pits, branchial cleft sinus tracts, and renal anomalies. The pathogenesis of the disease remains unknown; however, the defective gene has been localized to chromosome 8q by family linkage studies.
