Intrafamilial clinical variability in type C brachydactyly: In this report we describe a 4-generation family in which three members present variable clinical and radiological manifestations of brachydactyly type C. The observation of 'skipped generations' in the present family and in a few other families reported previously, may indicate that brachydactyly type C is not a true autosomal dominant condition due to mutations in a single gene.
