The index case was a Maori bushman who presented with severe congenital spinal stenosis and manifestations of distal arthrogryposis. His offspring and 8 of his 9 sibs and most of their offspring were interviewed and examined. Of those examined 7 individuals with definite and 2 with probable distal arthrogryposis were identified in 4 of the families. A tenth relative with distal arthrogryposis and contractural arachnodactyly had died. There was marked variability in the severity and nature of manifestations with 2 having severe hand and foot involvement in addition to craniofacial changes compatible with a diagnosis of Freeman-Sheldon syndrome. Other apparently unrelated hereditary disorders in the family included ectrodactyly, biliary atresia, and Brachmann-de Lange syndrome. This is the first report of arthrogryposis in a Maori family.
