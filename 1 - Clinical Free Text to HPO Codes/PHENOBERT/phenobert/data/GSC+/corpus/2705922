This study of 47 patients from 11 families with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF 2) confirms our previously reported association between posterior capsular cataract and NF 2. A highly significant statistical association was found between the presence of posterior capsular lens opacities and the presence of NF 2 as determined by magnetic resonance imaging or pathologic diagnosis. This association was not present for other types of lens opacities that could be the result of age-related or nonspecific changes. When considering the diagnosis of NF 2, this finding now makes it essential to use a careful dilated biomicroscopic examination of the lens to evaluate known, suspected, or at-risk individuals for this potentially early associated manifestation.
