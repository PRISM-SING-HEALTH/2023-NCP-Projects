A 1-year-old male with branchio-oculo-facial syndrome together with preaxial polydatyly and a white forelock at birth is described. This is only the second case where preaxial polydactyly has been described in branchio-oculo-facial syndrome. In both cases a diagnosis of Waardenburg syndrome had been considered.
