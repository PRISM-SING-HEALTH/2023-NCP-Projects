In situ hybridization with a c-sis probe was performed on peripheral lymphocytes of a man with neurofibromatosis and a ring 22 chromosome. Hybridization was observed on both the normal #22 and the ring 22, indicating that the patient is not constitutionally hemizygous for c-sis. The implications of a ring 22 constitution and the neurofibromatosis phenotype are discussed.
