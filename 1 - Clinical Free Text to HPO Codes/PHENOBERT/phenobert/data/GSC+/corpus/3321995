We observed an autosomal dominant disorder of abnormal upper lip, which resembles a poorly repaired cleft lip, malformed nose with broad bridge and flattened tip, lacrimal duct obstruction, malformed ears, and branchial cleft sinuses and/or linear skin lesions behind the ears in several persons in 3 families. In each of the 3 families, an affected parent had at least one affected child. Father-to-son transmission in one of these families ruled out X-linked inheritance. Other anomalies include coloboma, microphthalmia, auricular pits, lip pits, highly arched plate, dental anomalies, and subcutaneous cysts of the scalp. Premature graying of hair occurred in the affected adults. Growth retardation, developmental delay, and hand anomalies are variable components of the syndrome.
