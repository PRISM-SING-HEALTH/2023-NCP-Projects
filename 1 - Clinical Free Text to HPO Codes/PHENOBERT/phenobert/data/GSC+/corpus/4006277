Branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome is a developmental complex presenting with various combinations of ear pits, branchial cleft cysts, deafness and renal anomalies, which is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. This report describes a father and 2 children with BOR syndrome in which gustatory lacrimation (GL) was also present in 2 of them. GL is considered to be a rare, non-hereditary type of anomalous, cranial nerve-end organ innervation. Since lacrimal stenosis, which can clinically mimic GL, is also a feature of the BOR syndrome, future reports require lacrimal reflex testing and duct patency evaluation to define this variation in the BOR phenotype.
