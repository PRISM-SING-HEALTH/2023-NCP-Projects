Herve et al. (2010) reported an Algerian family in which 5 males were affected with a multisystem disorder characterized by moyamoya angiopathy, short stature, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, facial dysmorphism, and early-onset cataracts. The proband developed repeated episodes of sudden right arm weakness at age 22 years, and was later found to have cortical and subcortical infarcts associated with moyamoya disease on brain imaging. He had facial dysmorphism, with mild congenital ptosis, long philtrum, retrognathia, and premature graying of the hair. He also had short stature, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, decreased testicular volume, and azoospermia. Cardiac function was compromised due to dilated cardiomyopathy. He had recurrent episodes of heart failure and neurologic deficits, and died at age 34 years of heart failure.   Miskinyte et al. (2011) described the family reported by Herve et al. (2010) and 2 additional unrelated families with a similar disorder. There were 9 affected males in all. The age at onset of acute neurologic events ranged between 4 and 36 years of age, and both cerebral infarcts and hemorrhages occurred. All had short stature and facial dysmorphism, which variably included wide nose, deep-set eyes, low-set ears, hypertelorism, ptosis, long philtrum, and flared nares. Other features included hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (7/9 patients), hypertension (3/9 patients), partial growth hormone deficiency (4/9 patients), dilated cardiomyopathy (3/9 patients), premature coronary heart disease (1/9 patients), and premature hair graying (6/9 patients). Gonadal failure was associated with azoospermia. Four patients in 1 family had early-onset cataracts, and 2 patients from another family had developmental delay.
