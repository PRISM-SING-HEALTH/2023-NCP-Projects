Martin et al. (2014) reported 5 families with 1 or 2 affected children in the northwest region of England who suffered from early onset of severe chronic viral infections, mostly caused by herpesviruses, including EBV and VZV, as well as recurrent encapsulated bacterial infections. Two patients had EBV-driven B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Overall, the clinical phenotype was severe, with 3 patients having died. Six of 8 patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. None of the patients had extra-hematopoietic manifestations. Immunologic investigations showed that most patients had variable lymphopenia, which was exacerbated during infectious episodes with inversed CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio (601083), whereas other blood cell counts were usually normal. IgG levels were normal or elevated with increased IgG but low IgG2 levels with low antibody titers to Streptococcus pneumoniae. Further analyses performed in 1 patient showed naive CD4+ T-cell lymphopenia, increased numbers of effector memory T cells, low numbers of memory CD27+ B cells, a complete absence of both invariant T-cell populations (iNKT and MAIT cells), and impaired PHA- and antigen-induced proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
