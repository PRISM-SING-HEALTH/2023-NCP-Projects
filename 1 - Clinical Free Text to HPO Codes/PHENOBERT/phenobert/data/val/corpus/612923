Fremeaux-Bacchi et al. (2004) reported 3 unrelated patients with aHUS. The first patient was a 32-year-old woman who developed aHUS after pregnancy. Renal biopsy showed thrombotic microangiopathy. She had decreased serum factor I, factor B (CFB; 138470), and C3, indicating consumptive depletion of these complement proteins. Her unaffected father also carried the mutation; he had decreased serum factor I. The second patient developed aHUS with severe microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, hypertension, and proteinuria at age 17 months. He had a relapse 6 months later. Two years later, his renal function was normal, but he required antihypertensive treatment. His clinically unaffected mother also carried the mutation. Although serum factor I levels were normal in both the patient and his mother, both showed decreased serum C3 and factor B. The third patient was a 26-year-old woman who had recurrence of HUS following a second renal transplantation and thrombotic microangiopathy. Serum factor I levels were 36% of normal.
