Baple et al. (2014) reported 4 patients between 11 and 31 years of age from an extended Ohio Amish family with a neurodegenerative syndrome. The main features included delayed development or learning difficulties, prelingual sensorineural hearing loss, progressive gait instability and ataxia, progressive muscle weakness, dysarthria, dysphagia, and cognitive decline with age. All patients had short stature (-3.8 to -5.2 SD), and the 2 oldest patients never underwent a pubertal growth spurt. Other features included cutaneous and conjunctival telangiectasia, photophobia, and photosensitivity, with evidence of predisposition to sun-induced malignancy in 1 patient. Another patient showed premature aging. Brain MRI of 1 patient revealed cerebellar atrophy. The features were reminiscent of syndromes caused by DNA repair defects, such as xeroderma pigmentosum (see, e.g., XPA; 278700), Cockayne syndrome (see, e.g., CSA; 216400), and ataxia-telangiectasia (AT; 208900). None of the patients reported by Baple et al. (2014) had evidence of immunodeficiency.
