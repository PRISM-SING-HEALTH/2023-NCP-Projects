Wilson et al. (1991) described a kindred in which males in 5 successive generations in an X-linked recessive pedigree pattern had a mental retardation syndrome. The 14 living males in the 3 most recent generations permitted definition of other features: obesity, gynecomastia, speech difficulties, emotional lability, tapering fingers, and small feet. Some of the features resembled those of Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome (BFLS; 301900), but the patients of Wilson et al. (1991) did not have hypermetropia or cataracts in later life and did not have elongated earlobes. As pointed out by Frezal (1992), the same condition was reported by Vasquez et al. (1979). Turner (1992) had suggested that the patients of Vasquez et al. (1979) might have had BFLS.   Harakalova et al. (2012) reported a 5-generation Dutch family in which 7 males had a syndromic form of severe intellectual disability and 7 females had a milder phenotype. The males had mental retardation, truncal obesity, gynecomastia, hypogonadism, short stature, small hands, and a typical face characterized by a small head, small ears, prominent supraorbital ridges, deep-set eyes, high malar bones, broad nasal tip, columella somewhat below the nasal alae, thin upper vermilion, and retrognathia. None of the men could live independently. Female carriers had learning disorders and recognizable facial features, including high malar bones and broad nasal tip. In addition, 2 males and 1 female had learning problems without additional features. Harakalova et al. (2012) stated that the phenotype resembled that described by Wilson et al. (1991), which differs by larger stature and head, larger chin, coarser facial features, and tapering fingers. Moreover, females in the family reported by Wilson et al. (1991) were not affected.
