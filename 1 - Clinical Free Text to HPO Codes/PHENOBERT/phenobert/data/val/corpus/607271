Chun et al. (2002) reported 2 sibs, a 12-year-old female and an 11-year-old male, born of consanguineous parents, who presented with lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly associated with an immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent sinopulmonary and herpes simplex virus infections. Both sibs showed poor responses to immunization. The affected sibs had defects in activation of T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and natural killer cells, and defective CD95-mediated apoptosis. The unaffected mother, father, and sister were clinically well, although their peripheral blood lymphocytes showed partial defects in CD95-mediated apoptosis.
