In Nettleship's family (Nettleship, 1909, 1912), congenital posterior polar opacities were present and scattered cortical opacities appeared in childhood and progressed to total cataract. Tulloh (1955) described 15 affected in 5 generations. Valk and Binkhorst (1956) described associated choroideremia and myopia in 2 generations.   Ionides et al. (1997) reported 10 affected members of a family with autosomal dominant posterior polar cataract. The opacity, which was bilateral in all cases, consisted of a single well-defined plaque confined to the posterior pole of the lens and varied from 0.5 to 3 mm in diameter. Because of its proximity to the optical center of the eye, posterior polar cataract can have a marked effect on visual acuity. Hospital records indicated that the opacity was usually present at birth or developed within the first few months of life but did not progress with age to other regions of the lens. There was no evidence of posterior lenticonus or high myopia and no family history of other ocular or systemic abnormalities.   McKay et al. (2005) studied a 6-generation Tasmanian family segregating autosomal dominant congenital cataract, previously studied by Burdon et al. (2004), in which most of the 13 patients were elderly and aphakic with no preoperative clinical notes available, although cataracts in 2 patients had been described as 'complete.' Most affected individuals were diagnosed shortly after birth, and the mean age of cataract surgery was 3 years, 4 months. Of the 12 aphakic patients, 11 had nystagmus, 2 had exotropia, 4 had esotropia, and 4 had bilateral aphakic glaucoma. One obligate carrier was phakic with good vision, but unavailable for slit-lamp examination. No other ocular or systemic abnormalities were noted in this family.   Shiels et al. (2008) studied a 4-generation Caucasian family segregating autosomal dominant posterior polar cataracts with no systemic abnormalities. Ophthalmic records indicated that the cataracts usually presented in both eyes as disc-shaped posterior subcapsular opacities with evidence of posterior lenticonus. In 3 affected individuals, opacification progressed to affect the central (nuclear) and anterior polar regions of the lens. One affected individual also had monocular amblyopia, and 2 others developed strabismus requiring corrective surgery. Age at diagnosis ranged from birth to 15 years, and age at surgery ranged from 0 to 44 years; post-surgical corrected visual acuity varied from 20/20 to 20/70 in the better eye.
