In a family reported by Riddell (1941), affected males showed large cornea as an isolated defect. Heterozygous women may show slight increase in corneal diameter. Two presumed homozygous females occurred in this family.   Skuta et al. (1983) studied 2 brothers with megalocornea and their 2 affected maternal uncles. The deceased maternal great-grandfather was reported to have had large eyes and cataracts. Examination of the 4 affected individuals revealed corneal diameters ranging from 13 to 15.5 mm, deep anterior chambers, and normal intraocular pressure. Additional features included atrophy of the iris stroma, iridodonesis, astigmatic refractive errors in the vertical meridian, lens subluxation, and cataract formation. Two of the patients exhibited transillumination of the irides, a feature not previously reported in this disorder, and the oldest patient, aged 54 years, displayed posterior 'crocodile shagreen' bilaterally, believed to represent opacities of the central stroma. Endothelial specular microscopy of affected individuals disclosed normal endothelial cell densities and morphologic characteristics and increased total endothelial cell populations, suggesting that the process involved in the development of megalocornea is one of primary overgrowth rather than secondary distention. Eye examination of 3 daughters of 1 of the affected men showed normal results except for amblyopia in 1 of them, and there was no history of women in the family with unusually large eyes or other ocular problems.   Mackey et al. (1991) studied 16 affected males from 5 unrelated families, including a large 5-generation family ('family 1') with linkage to Xq21.3-q22 (Chen et al., 1989), and found that affected males had corneal diameters between 13.0 and 16.5 mm. Arcus juvenilis, mosaic corneal dystrophy, and cataracts were found only in adult affected males. No abnormality was identified in carrier females.   Webb et al. (2012) ascertained 6 families segregating X-linked megalocornea. Affected individuals had corneal diameters ranging from 14 mm to 16 mm, large anterior chamber depths, decreased central corneal thickness, mosaic corneal degeneration ('shagreen'), corneal arcus juvenilis, and, in older patients, cataract. Iris transillumination with pigment dispersion was seen in all patients examined. No patient had glaucoma or significant vision loss, and no neurologic or systemic abnormalities were detected. Carrier females had no clinical signs of megalocornea.
