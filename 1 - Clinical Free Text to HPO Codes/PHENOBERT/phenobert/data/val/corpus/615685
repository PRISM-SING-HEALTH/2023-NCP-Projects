Novarino et al. (2014) reported a complicated form of spastic paraplegia with polysensory and motor neuropathy in 2 branches of a highly consanguineous family (family 827). In each branch of the family, 2 sibs were affected. Phenotypic features of only one set of sibs were described. Both presented at 14 months of age with inability to walk unsupported and with a scissors gait. At their last examinion at ages 11 and 12 years, both had difficulty walking with support and were essentially considered nonambulatory. Both had spasticity with increased patellar and absent Achilles tendon reflexes as well as diffuse polysensory and motor neuropathy with loss of terminal digits due to acropathy. Both had normal cognition. Novarino et al. (2014) called the disorder in this family spastic paraplegia-61.
