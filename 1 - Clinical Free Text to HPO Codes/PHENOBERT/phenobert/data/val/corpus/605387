Yamada et al. (2000) described a Japanese family in which 10 members in 4 generations were affected with autosomal dominant posterior polar cataract. The cataract was characterized by progressive, disc-shaped, posterior subcapsular opacity.   Shiels et al. (2007) reported 15 affected individuals in a large 6-generation Caucasian family with progressive childhood posterior subcapsular cataracts. Cataracts progressed with age to affect the nucleus and anterior subcapsular regions of the lens. Age at diagnosis varied from 4 to 20 years.
