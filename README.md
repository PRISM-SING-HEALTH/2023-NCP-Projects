Projects
========

This repository holds 5 different projects, each designed to tackle a different healthcare-related problem using different technologies and approaches.

Clinical Free Text to HPO Codes
-------------------------------

This project aims to extract clinical information from free text and convert it into Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) codes. The HPO is a standardized vocabulary of phenotypic abnormalities, which can be used for computational analysis of human disease.

Technologies used: Python, Natural Language Processing (NLP), HPO.

Integrating Family History Into The Electronic Health Records (EHR)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This project aims to integrate family history information into Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve patient care. The project uses a combination of data mining, NLP, and machine learning techniques to extract and standardize family history information from unstructured EHR data.

Technologies used: Python, NLP, machine learning, EHR.

Making Genetic Testing Reports Machine-Readable
-----------------------------------------------

This project aims to convert genetic testing reports, which are often in a non-machine-readable format, into a structured format that can be used for computational analysis. The project uses a combination of NLP, rule-based methods, and machine learning to extract and standardize genetic information from unstructured text.

Technologies used: Python, NLP, machine learning, genetic testing.

Data Mining to Identify At-Risk Genetic and Rare Diseases Patients
------------------------------------------------------------------

This project aims to identify patients who may be at risk for genetic or rare diseases using data mining techniques. The project uses a combination of machine learning and data mining methods to identify patterns in patient data that may be indicative of these diseases.

Technologies used: Python, machine learning, data mining, genetic and rare diseases.

Texture-Patch based evaluation of skin and eye surfaces from 3D facial Images
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project aims to evaluate the skin and eye surfaces from 3D facial images using texture-patch-based methods. The project uses a combination of computer vision and machine learning techniques to identify and analyze specific regions of interest in the facial images.

Technologies used: Python, computer vision, machine learning, 3D facial images.
